SuperGlue is a web-based tool for molecular annotation and similarity search. Users can upload chemical compound datasets, visualize molecular structures, and perform similarity searches to analyze relationships between compounds.

## Features
- Upload and preview **CSV files** with compound data.
- **Similarity search** for molecular structures using different metrics.
- **Interactive visualization** of molecular structures.
- **Molecular editing and annotation** powered by **Ketcher**.
- Responsive **frontend (React)** and powerful **backend (Python/RDKit)**.

## Tech Stack  
### **Frontend (React + Vite)**
- React (JavaScript)
- Vite (Fast frontend bundler)
- Styled Components & CCS Modules

### **Backend (Python + RDKit)**
- Flask (API)
- RDKit (Molecular similarity)
- Pandas (Data processing)

## Installation
### **1. Clone the Repository**
### **2. Set Up Backend**
### **3. Start Backend**
### **4. Set Up Frontend**

## Usage
1. **Upload a CSV file** with compound IDs and SMILES.
2. **Navigate the dataset** using the summary page.
3. **Click on a compound** to view its molecular structure.
4. **Use Ketcher** to edit molecular structures and add annotations.
5. **Perform a similarity search** by entering a SMILES query.
